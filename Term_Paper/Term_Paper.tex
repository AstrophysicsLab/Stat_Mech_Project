% In Latex the % symbol will indicate a comment. Text following the % symbol will not appear in the generated document and allow you to annotate your latex file
% This document is a modified version of the "sample document" provided by the American Journal of Physics through their author's guide.

\documentclass[prl,twocolumn]{revtex4-1}  % The "prl" tells latex to use the physical review letters formatting with one column from the revtex4.1 document class
%\documentclass[prl,preprint,linenumbers]{revtex4-1}  % other options can change formatting for various purposes. For example you can include line numbers with "linenumbers" and the "preprint" to make things easier to edit. Similarly you could use "singlecolumn" and "doublespace"
% NOTE: only a single documentclass should be declared. Comment out the other one. You can try changing styles and classes and compiling the document to see one of the benefits of Latex, the ease of reformatting.
